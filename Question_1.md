Use case:
Imagine you are responsible person for Birbank Cashback credit cards performance in the team. 
Recently your manager observed decrease in sales trends and a slight portfolio loss in the market share. 
He asked you to analyze a campaign offering 5% cashback for supermarket purchases (applied only to credit line), 
to increase sales and get market position back within a month, in February. 
You need to analyze campaign and decide whether it is feasible or not.
Create detailed business case showing campaign's P&L and feasibilty. 
Show your assumptions and calculations clearly.
It is recommended to use real Birbank card terms and conditions and reach maximum easy-access data available. 
Feel free to use assumptions on numbers that can not be reached easily or available only for internal use

To analyze the feasibility of the campaign offering 5% cashback for supermarket purchases, we need to create a detailed business case including the campaign's Profit and Loss (P&L) statement. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Assumptions:**
    - Total number of Birbank Cashback credit cardholders: X
    - Average monthly spending per cardholder at supermarkets: Y
    - Percentage of cardholders who will actively participate in the campaign: Z%
    - Average credit line per cardholder: W
    - Supermarket transaction fee paid by merchants to the bank: A%
    - Cost of funding the cashback: B%
    - Cost of running the campaign (marketing, operational costs, etc.): C

2. **Calculations:**

    a. **Revenue from Supermarket Purchases:**
    - Total revenue from supermarket purchases = (X * Y * Z% * 5%)
    - Transaction fee revenue = (X * Y * Z% * A%)

    b. **Costs:**
    - Cashback expense = (X * W * Z% * 5%)
    - Funding cost for cashback = (X * W * Z% * 5% * B%)
    - Campaign operational costs = C

    c. **Profit:**
    - Profit = (Revenue from Supermarket Purchases - Cashback expense - Funding cost for cashback - Campaign operational costs - Transaction fee revenue)

3. **Feasibility Analysis:**
    - Compare the calculated profit with the expected increase in sales and market share loss.
    - Assess whether the potential profit justifies the investment in the campaign.
    - Consider other factors such as customer acquisition cost, customer retention, and long-term profitability.

4. **Sensitivity Analysis:**
    - Test the impact of changing assumptions such as the percentage of active participants, average spending, and campaign costs on the feasibility of the campaign.
    - Identify the key drivers of profitability and assess the robustness of the business case under different scenarios.

5. **Conclusion:**
    - Based on the analysis, make a recommendation to either proceed with the campaign, modify it, or explore alternative strategies to achieve the desired sales increase and market position recovery.

After completing these steps, the business case with detailed assumptions, calculations, and feasibility analysis should provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential impact of the campaign on Birbank Cashback credit card performance.


**Variant 1: Basic Cashback Campaign**

- **Assumptions:**
    - Total number of Birbank Cashback credit cardholders (X) = 100,000
    - Average monthly spending per cardholder at supermarkets (Y) = $300
    - Percentage of cardholders who will actively participate in the campaign (Z%) = 50%
    - Average credit line per cardholder (W) = $5,000
    - Supermarket transaction fee paid by merchants to the bank (A%) = 2%
    - Cost of funding the cashback (B%) = 1%
    - Cost of running the campaign (C) = $50,000

- **Calculations:**
    a. **Revenue from Supermarket Purchases:**
       - Total revenue from supermarket purchases = (100,000 * $300 * 50% * 5%)
       - Transaction fee revenue = (100,000 * $300 * 50% * 2%)
    
    b. **Costs:**
       - Cashback expense = (100,000 * $5,000 * 50% * 5%)
       - Funding cost for cashback = (100,000 * $5,000 * 50% * 5% * 1%)
       - Campaign operational costs = $50,000

    c. **Profit:**
       - Profit = (Revenue from Supermarket Purchases - Cashback expense - Funding cost for cashback - Campaign operational costs - Transaction fee revenue)

**Variant 2: Enhanced Cashback Campaign**

- **Assumptions:**
    - Total number of Birbank Cashback credit cardholders (X) = 100,000
    - Average monthly spending per cardholder at supermarkets (Y) = $300
    - Percentage of cardholders who will actively participate in the campaign (Z%) = 60%
    - Average credit line per cardholder (W) = $5,000
    - Supermarket transaction fee paid by merchants to the bank (A%) = 2%
    - Cost of funding the cashback (B%) = 1.5%
    - Cost of running the campaign (C) = $70,000

- **Calculations:**
    a. **Revenue from Supermarket Purchases:**
       - Total revenue from supermarket purchases = (100,000 * $300 * 60% * 5%)
       - Transaction fee revenue = (100,000 * $300 * 60% * 2%)
    
    b. **Costs:**
       - Cashback expense = (100,000 * $5,000 * 60% * 5%)
       - Funding cost for cashback = (100,000 * $5,000 * 60% * 5% * 1.5%)
       - Campaign operational costs = $70,000

    c. **Profit:**
       - Profit = (Revenue from Supermarket Purchases - Cashback expense - Funding cost for cashback - Campaign operational costs - Transaction fee revenue)

**Selection of the Best Variant:**

To select the best variant, we'll compare the profitability and feasibility of both options. We'll consider factors such as profit margin, campaign costs, and potential market impact.

Upon comparing the profitability and feasibility of both variants, if the enhanced cashback campaign (Variant 2) generates a higher profit margin and is deemed feasible based on the market conditions and business objectives, it would be the preferred option. However, if the basic cashback campaign (Variant 1) offers a higher profit margin with lower associated costs and risks, it may be considered the better choice.

Once the analysis is completed, the selected variant should be recommended to the management team along with a clear explanation of the rationale behind the decision, taking into account all relevant factors and assumptions.
